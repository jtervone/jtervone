Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jarkko Tervonen, full stack developer working in Finland with 25 years of experience of web developing. Most of the time I have developed content management systems and other marketing tools. Currently I'm working at @lianatech.

In daily life I use `.php`, `.js`, `.sql`, `.html`, and `.css`. I'm also very interested to study new languages and test a new frameworks (frontend, backend and testing). In addition to this I'm very familiar with various cloud environments and CI/CD systems.

My days is not fullfilled by programming and developing. I like to do sports like (mountain) biking, cross country skiing and running. Also you can find me at hiking paths or photographing birds in the woods.
